# Tools used

-Microsoft Excel

# Data Exploration
There are 13 columns in total listing the average information for a customer. Each customer comes with a unique ID. Using Find and Select we have found no null values or cells filled with errors.

# Data Cleaning

The data is already in a pretty useable state. We will only make a few slight formatting adjustments.

1. Extend the abbreviations of Martial Status and Gender into their full words for readability. 
2. There are various ages listed across the dataset. So we will add a new column that groups them into age brackets:
   -Young
   -Middle Age
   -Old
